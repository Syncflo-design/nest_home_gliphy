"""List B — 'Awaiting My Action': documents in a state needing a decision from
the user's seat.

This is the extensible part. Rather than hardcode three doctypes, List B is
driven by a table of RULES. Each rule says: which doctype, what state counts as
"awaiting action", which permission gates it, and how to render title/subtitle.
Adding a new source later = appending a rule dict (or, eventually, a
"Nest Home Gliphy Awaiting Rule" doctype that feeds this same shape).

v1 rule for all three sources: a document is "awaiting my action" when it is a
DRAFT (docstatus = 0) and the current user holds SUBMIT permission on that
doctype — i.e. it is sitting on their desk waiting for them to approve/submit.
Read-level row permissions are applied automatically by frappe.get_list run as
the session user, so users only ever see drafts they're allowed to see.
