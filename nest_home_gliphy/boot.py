"""Per-user landing-page resolution for nest_home_gliphy.

The product principle is "push, not pull": when a user logs in, the page that
already shows their work should be the front door. As of v0.0.3 the redirect to
nest-home-gliphy is gated on the user actually having a Nest Home Gliphy Layout that matches
their Role Profile or Role -- if they don't, they are left on the standard desk.

Precedence:
    1. the user's own Preferred Landing Page  (if overrides are allowed)
    2. nest-home-gliphy                               (ONLY if a layout matches them)
    3. the app default                         (Nest Home Gliphy Settings.default_landing)

get_user_home_page is wired as the get_website_user_home_page hook; despite the
name it is consulted in Frappe's get_home_page() resolution. Returning None lets
the framework fall through to the standard desk.
